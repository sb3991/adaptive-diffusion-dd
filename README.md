Official Repository for the AAAI 2026 Accepted Paper
“An Adaptive Sampling Framework for Diffusion-based Dataset Distillation with High Fidelity and Diversity”

This repository will contain the official implementation of our adaptive sampling–based dataset distillation framework, which leverages diffusion models to generate compact yet high-quality synthetic datasets.

The full paper will be available soon on the AAAI 2026 proceedings.
